# Bitcoin-Mining-with-Hash
In this project I am going to mine bitcoins with the help of a module named Hashlib.
We can mine bitcoing with the help of python.
Run the file naned 'BTC Mining.py' to create a hash which can be used to get Bitcoins.
If you set the difficulty level as 25, you will get a reward of around 6 BTC which is around 2 cores.
Disclaimer: this project is for educational purpose and the BTC can be claimed when you are cartified as a BTC miner.
